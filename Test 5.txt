THE CLOUD SCULPTORS
     -
  The air finds flight in forms of lofty wind
  As one with nature's children taking part
  And soaring up to go and find a friend
  Then join with water spinning wispy art.
     -
  This nature's process has eternal known
  The way to hang up on the sky these drapes
  But wonder not how these soft clouds have grown
  From fleecy strand filled webs to take their shapes?
     -
  Perhaps the artist's brush a thing unseen
  With living tools the Elder Gods express
  Those firey ones whose scales and talons gleam
  To grace the heavens with their soft caress.
     -
    Now see the strokes of carving wings along
    With falling rain - the strains of Dragon song.
